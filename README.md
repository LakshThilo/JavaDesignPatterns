# Java Design Patterns
Whatâ€™s a design pattern?

Design Patterns are very popular among software developers. A design pattern is a well-described solution to a common software problem.
In this project, I have described all Design Patterns with the examples. The project consists of three main packages.
    
    - Creational
    
    - Structural
    
    - Behavioural
    
What does the project consist of?

Most patterns are described very formally so somebody can reproduce them in many contexts. Here are the sections that are usually present in a project description:

    - Note:  This consists of a brief note about each design pattern with a real-world example
    - UML Diagram: further explains using the UML diagram to get a better understanding
    - Structure of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
    - Code examples: in one each design pattern consists of two examples, and some of the examples contain two packages before and after packages. 
      Before-package shows the code before applying the design pattern, and After-package shows how the code looks after applying the design pattern.
