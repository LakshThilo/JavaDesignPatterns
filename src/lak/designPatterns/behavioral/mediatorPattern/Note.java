/*  The actual definition of a mediator is someone who tries to make people in conflict, come to an agreement.
    They act as a neutral party who sits in between all of the others so that they don't speak to each other directly.
    In Java, the mediator pattern is a way for objects to communicate so that they are loosely coupled.

    As a real life example, imagine a restaurant, the customer is at their table and they need to communicate
    what they want to eat. The chefs are in the kitchen and they need to know what to cook. And then the meal
    needs to be brought out. The owner of the restaurant needs to make a profit to run the restaurant.
    So money needs to be collected from the customers. Imagine how it would work if there was no waiter or waitress.
    The customer would have to go to the kitchen to tell the chefs what they want. Then the chefs would have to
    bring out the food and at the end of the meal, the owner would have to come into the restaurant to collect
    the payments. In this scenario, a waiter or waitress is like a mediator handling all of these interactions
    so that these groups of people don't have to interact with each other directly.

    So if we go back to coding in object oriented design, you often end up with large applications that have
    lots of different objects. We're taught that classes should be small and self contained. So you often have lots
    of different ones which leads to lots of different objects. This is good it means that each class is focused on
    it's one thing and the behavior of the application as a whole is split into small chunks. But one of the downsides
    that can occur is that you end up with a system with lots of different objects that all know about each other
    and are all interconnected. You might even end up with a situation where every object knows about every other objects.

    this leads to tight coupling between objects and changes to one might result in the need for changes to another.
    It might also make it difficult to reuse objects because they might have to communicate with so many others.
    The idea of the mediator pattern is to have an object that's sole purpose is to handle these interactions between
    all of the different objects. It sits in the middle of them all and handles the communications between them.
    This provides a loose coupling between the objects and this makes the program simpler to understand and to maintain.*/
