    /** what is a design pattern? A design pattern is a way of structuring code to solve a specific problem.
     * The aim is to make use of solutions to common problems and make code more elegant and flexible. */

    /**
     * Behavioral design patterns are about how objects assign responsibilities between each other.
     * They're concerned with how objects are connected, how they communicate with each other,
     * and how responsibilities are assigned between them.


     * There are two different types of behavioral design pattern, class patterns and objects patterns.
     * You can think of the difference between class patterns and object patterns as the difference between is a and has a relationships.
     -For example, a dog is an animal and a dog has a tail.

     Class Patterns are concerned with the Is a Relationships and Object Patterns are concerned with the Has a Relationships.

     1. Behavioral Class Patterns are concerned with how classes Share Responsibilities between Themselves. This is usually done with Inheritance.

     2. Behavioral Object Patterns are the most common type. These are about how different objects interact with each other.
     Sometimes they are a way to help different objects work together to perform a certain task.
     And sometimes they're about delegating requests to other objects. Behavioral objects patterns use Composition instead of inheritance.*/

    /**Inheritance and composition are two programming techniques developers use to establish relationships between classes and objects.
     - Whereas inheritance derives one class from another,
     - composition defines a class as the sum of its parts. */
