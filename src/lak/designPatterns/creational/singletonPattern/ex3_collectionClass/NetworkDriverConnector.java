/*      There is also a class called NetworkDriveConnector. Similarly to the PrintSpooler,
        the NetworkDriveConnector manages access to resources, in this case, network drives rather than printers. In this particular
        application, it is okay for multiple processors to be accessing the network drive. This is different to the PrintSpooler class,
        which should only be used once in the application.*/
