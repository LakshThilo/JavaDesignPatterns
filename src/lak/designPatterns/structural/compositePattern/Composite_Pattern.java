    /* Imagine a quiz night where people can choose to enter the quiz on their own. The person running the quiz has a list
        of all the people answering the quiz, but then some groups of people might want to enter as teams. The person running
        the quiz will treat the group of people as one entry, the same as the people entering on their own.

        In the context of the composite pattern, the group of people would be a composite that can be treated in the same
        way as an individual person answering.

        In Java, you've probably come across the concepts of Varargs. These are methods that take an argument, and the type
        of argument is followed by three dots. This notation means that when you call this method, you can pass in one variable,
        two variables, or however many variables you like.*/

       /**So in a typical Java app, a good place to use the composite pattern is where you want to treat single objects and groups
        of objects in the same way. If you're handling different types of objects in a similar way and you have code that's very
        similar or identical to handle these different types, this is when to start thinking about using the composite pattern.*/
