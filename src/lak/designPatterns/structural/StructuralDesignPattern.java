/*      Structural design patterns are all to do with how classes and objects are structured and used together to form larger structures.
        There are two different types of structural patterns, class patterns and object patterns. You can think of the difference between
        class patterns and object patterns as the difference between is a and has a relationships. For example, a car is a vehicle, and a
        car has an engine. Class patterns are concerned with the is a relationships, and object patterns are concerned with the has a
        relationships. You can probably guess that class patterns are all to do with how classes are structured and interact. There's a
        particular focus on how inheritance is used to create structures. Several of these patterns make use of interfaces to define shared
        functionality. Structural object patterns, on the other hand, are all about how to use objects. Structural patterns can allow you
        to change the behavior of individual objects at runtime.
